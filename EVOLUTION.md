- Created a "hello world" API endpoint in `hello_api.py` using Flask.
- Searched for files related to vector embeddings; no relevant files found.
- Retrieved and saved the latest news from Ada Derana to `adaderana_news.txt`.
- Summarized the relationship between "memory logic" and "graph traversals": Memory logic provides the hardware for data storage and processing, while graph traversals are software algorithms that operate on graph-structured data in memory.
- Performed semantic searches for "vector embedding implementation"; no relevant snippets found.
- Indexed the workspace in deep mode, skipping summaries. (Multiple times)

*   **User Preference:** Index the workspace in deep mode, skipping summaries.
*   **Action:** Deep index of the knowledge graph, skipping summaries.
*   **Result:** Knowledge graph indexed in deep mode, summaries skipped. Graph contains 288 nodes and 303 edges.
*   **User Action:** Walk the graph starting from "memory management logic".
*   **Result:** Found one connected node: `web-surf/index.ts` within the `web-surf` skill directory.
*   **User Action:** Walk the graph starting from "memory management logic".
*   **Result:** Found one connected node: the `web-surf` directory, specifically `workspace/skills/web-surf/index.ts`.
*   **User Action:** Restart the server.
